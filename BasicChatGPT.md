ChatGPT is a product from the OpenAI company and this website allows you to interact with this amazing technology. How amazing is it? This web site has gained more active users faster than any other - faster than Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, or Spotify!
1. In your browser, navigate to https://chat.openai.com/. You'll have to sign up or login with an existing account.
2. Enter: what are the historical names of istanbul?
The question you entered is called a prompt and it is sent to OpenAI's Large Language Model (or LLM).
There is some content moderation built into the tool so you can ask for a list of curse words, but it won't provide any.
3. Enter: how do I pronounce it?
There is a limitation on the length of each conversation you have with ChatGPT, but you can start new conversations at any time - and even return to previous conversations as desired. It's best to keep a single conversation centered on a single topic. 
4. At the top left of the page, click the New Conversation button. Enter: how much wood could
The value returned by OpenAI is called a completion. OpenAI's LLM isn't sentient or all-knowing. It is "merely" looking at your prompt and returning it's best guess.
5. Enter: Who won the latest World Cup and when was the final game?
As you can see by OpenAI's response, the underlying model has only been trained on data up to September 2021. (You can enter the same prompt into Bing's chat feature and get a different response.)
6. While OpenAI is constantly working to improve their model, it's responses can occasionally be inaccurate. When this happens, ChatGPT will often reply with the same confidence as when it responds accurately. These inaccuracies are often called hallucinations and it's why it's still critical to keep humans "in the loop" to verify any information before acting upon it.
7. To avoid some of the aforementioned hallucinations and to otherwise improve the response you get from ChatGPT, you can do so using a variety of techniques known as prompt engineering.
