#Vocabulary

**Completions** After the AI processes a  provided prompt, it returns the likeliest text which is known as a completion.

**Large Language Models** This is an approach to AI models that can predict the likeliest response to a natural language prompt. These models are based on a very large corpus of words and phrases. Large language models use deep neural networks and transformers to learn from trillions of words in order to produce texts on many topics.

**LLM** The abbreviation for Large Language Model

**Prompts** The text you provide OpenAI is called a prompt and is used by AI to generate a response. It's important to know that the text provided by an end user is often just a part of the entire prompt sent to the AI. Solutions often add more text or instruction for the AI as part of a technique called prompt engineering.

**Prompt Engineering** The emerging collection of creative techniques used to write prompts that coerce OpenAI to provide the best response.

**Tokens** The AI breaks up the various words in a prompt text into smaller tokens. This helps the AI better accommodate forms of words (e.g. '-ing' vs '-ed') and better understand the semantic context.
