We import the Puzzle Plugin into the Semantic Kernel by loading it it's location in our folder structure.\n",
    "- The MadLib Plugin generates the mad lib template to be used by the Puzzle Plugin. The MadLib Plugin only has one function as well, but it's a native function. This function requires a theme for the generated mad lib as well as a list of numbers so it knows how many adjectives, nouns, and verb blanks to create in the mad lib. As a native plugin, we'll just create an instance of the MadLibPlugin class and import it into the Semantic Kernel. \n",
    "- Finally the Chaos Plugin - which is another native plugin, but it has two functions. The default behavior of the GenerateRandomNumbers function is to generate three integers between 0 and 5. We'll use these defaults because we only need three integers (adjectives, nouns, and verbs) and to keep our mad libs somewhat small.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the ContextVariables object to pass values into the first function as well as between functions. The only variable we are required to initialize is the madLibTheme variable - which we defaulted to \"rock concert\". The other variables will actually be created within the native plugin functions. Open the ChaosPlugin.cs and the MadLibPlugin.cs to see where they are setting context variables. Open the semantic function FillTheBlanksFunction to see how it consumes the context variables it needs.\n",
    "- *NOTE: Feel free to change the madLibTheme context variable to generate a mad lib about something you think is interesting. :) You could also initialize context variables for lowerBound and upperBound parameters used by the GenerateRandomNumbers function. You can set them to higher integer values in order to force the AI to generate larger mad libs with more blanks to fill out.*\n",

    "The second to last line of code is where it all comes together. The Semantic Kernel's RunAsync method takes the Context Variables object (which just has the one madLibTheme context variable initially) and then runs each of the specified functions in order.
